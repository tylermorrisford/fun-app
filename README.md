# This app dot digital

This app was an excuse to play around with different front-end tech like fetch, react hooks, and data-visualization. It uses styled-components(big fan), but I otherwise made use of CRA's boilerplate CSS. I recently re-deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which allows for custom domains (<3 you Vercel) AND the deployment doesn't need to be built each time the app is loaded by a user(amazing), as well as automatically issuing a cert!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
