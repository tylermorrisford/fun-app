# This app dot digital

[thisapp.digital](http://thisapp.digital)

This app was an excuse to play around with different front-end tech like fetch, react hooks and data-visualization. It uses styled-components(big fan), but I otherwise made use of CRA's boilerplate CSS. It's deployed to Heroku, and will eventually move; while Heroku has some downsides, it's preeeeetty convenient.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
